<h1> Unforgiven Trilogy</h1>
<p> Most Metallica songs have very deep and interesting lyrics. These three songs are a trilogy and the same theme and story is continued in each of them. This is my interpretation of these three songs.<p>
<p> In "The Unforgiven", the singer speaks about growing up in a strict and uptight society.</p>
<p> The unforgiven 2 song picks up a few years after from where "The Unforgiven" leaves us. The young man is now an adult. He has left behind all the people who controlled him and has found someone he cares for.</p>
<p>The third and final song of this trilogy is not quite as linked as the first two are, but is more like a spin off. The singer here speaks of a person, who might have damaged his life</p>
